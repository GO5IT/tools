 This converter translates the Getty {{{http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/}AAT  and ULAN}} vocabularies 
 provided by the Getty Foundation into their SKOS (RDF) representation.
 
Source files
 
 {{{http://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/getty/} Parent directory for source files}}
 in the AnnoCultor source repository.
 
Data 

 Large samples of the vocabularies are provided for download at Getty. To run the demo you need to
 download {{{http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/aat/aat_xml_utf8_sample09.zip}AAT zip}} file 
 and {{{http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/ulan_xml_utf8_sample09.zip}ULAN zip}} file, and extract them to 
 <<<annocultor/demos/converters/getty/input_source/>>>. Specifically, we need files <<<AAT.xml>>> and <<<ULAN.xml>>>.
  
 To convert the complete vocabularies you need to obtain a license and their complete XML sources from Getty. 
   
Running

 Invoke <<<convert.bat AAT>>> or <<<convert.bat ULAN>>> from <<<annocultor/demos/converters/getty/>>>
    
Converter

 Both converters share
 
 * conversion 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/getty/profile/parameters-getty.xml}parameters}}
 
 
 * several 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/getty/profile/common-getty.xml}common conversion rules}} 
 
 The complete 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/getty/profile/profile-AAT.xml} AAT converter}}
 and 
 {{{https://annocultor.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/annocultor/demos/converters/getty/profile/profile-ULAN.xml} ULAN converter}}
 translate:
 
 * terms to <<<skos>>> terms,
 
 * labels to <<<skos:prefLabel>>> and <<<skos:altLabel>>>,
 
 * concept hierarchy into the <<<skos:broader>>> relation.
 
 In addition, it creates a number of custom properties, mostly for ULAN.
 
 This converter illustrates the following AnnoCultor features:
 
 * part-of objects, converting a part-of object to a few properties of the parent object
 
 * wildcards on source files 
 
 * property rename
 
 * faceted property rename
  
 * using listeners on converter and listeners on object rules together.
